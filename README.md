# practicas_tc2005b

This is the individual repository for my Software Construction (TC200B) course, where the practices and tasks I completed during the course are collected.

## Key Learning Areas

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Creation of user interfaces using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and design frameworks such as:
     - **Materialize**: Use of modern components and responsive design.
     - **Bulma**: Implementation of minimalist, Flexbox-based designs.

2. **JavaScript Programming**:
   - Use of **JavaScript** to add functionality to web applications.
   - Implementation of events and DOM manipulation.
   - Introduction to **AJAX** for making asynchronous requests and consuming APIs.

3. **Backend Development**:
   - Creation of servers with **Node.js**.
   - Use of frameworks like **Express.js** to handle routes and controllers.
   - Integration with databases for data persistence.

4. **Databases**:
   - Design of relational databases and SQL queries.
   - Use of subqueries, aggregate functions, and stored procedures.
   - Normalization and optimization of databases.

5. **Software Architecture and Design**:
   - Creation of class diagrams, entity-relationship models (ERD), and deployment diagrams.
   - Analysis of case studies to solve real-world problems.

6. **Development Best Practices**:
   - Use of controllers, models, and routes for a well-structured architecture.
   - Application of design principles and usability in interfaces.
   - Heuristic evaluation to improve user experience.

## Languages and Tools Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For the structure and styling of web applications.
- **JavaScript**: Main language for dynamic functionalities.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For backend application development.
- **SQL**: For database queries and manipulation.
- **CSS Frameworks**: Materialize and Bulma.
- **AJAX**: For asynchronous API consumption.
- **Design Tools**: Diagrams.net for diagrams and modeling.

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized into folders representing different labs and tasks:
- `laboratorio_X`: Code and specific configurations for each practice.
- `tareas`: Documents, diagrams, and additional exercises completed during the course.

This repository reflects the accumulated learning from the course and serves as a reference for future implementations.
